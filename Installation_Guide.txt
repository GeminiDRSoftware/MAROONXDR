INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR DRAGONS AND MAROON-X 

There are certain non-obvious steps that are currently necessary to ensure Dragons and Maroon-X data reduction work properly. 
Not following these steps will probably lead to run-time errors that are very difficult to diagnose.

1. If not already installed, install Anaconda.  If on an M1 Mac, ensure that you are using the x86 version of the Anaconda binaries. 

2. Set up a new conda environment with python version 3.10, Dragons, DS9, astropy version 5.2 and bokeh version 2.4.3.   The command will be formatted like this: conda create -n NAME python=3.10 dragons ds9 astropy=5.2 bokeh=2.4.3
NOTE:  IT IS CURRENTLY ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE YOU INSTALL OLDER VERSIONS OF ASTROPY AND BOKEH.  DRAGONS DOES NOT WORK WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF ASTROPY.

3. Edit simple_test.py to provide the correct path for your dark files (DDDDE files), and run this file.  It should execute correctly.
